# Survival-Game

Implemented a board game where 3 types of agents are trying to eliminate each other in order to survive.
Scattered items across the board can increase, more or less, the power and life of the agent who finds them.
The game ends with the last agent who remains alive.

Every class has a source file and a header file. The source file contains the implementations of the methods and the header file contains data members and the definitions of the methods.

There are two abstract classes, Item and Agent, with 3 subclasses each, 3 types of items, common, rare and legendary and 3 types of agents, AgentA, AgentB and AgentC.
